# Maricopa Co., AZ  
  
## Context  
On October 6, 2020, the New York Times published an [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/opinion/biden-trump-bellwether-counties-.html?searchResultPosition=1) outlining the 10 bellwether counties for the then-upcoming 2020 Presidential elections. On the list was Maricopa County, AZ, which accounts for almost two-thirds of Arizona's population.  

Fast forward to today, what we saw during the election was indeed a win in Arizona by President-Elect Biden, in no small part due to his carrying of Maricopa County. However, the numerous protests and baseless allegations of fraud by Republican voters in Maricopa County illustrated the strength of the Republican Party in the state.
